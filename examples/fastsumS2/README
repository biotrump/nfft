fastsumS2 - Fast summation of radial functions on the sphere

  This program computes approximations of sums of the form

            L-1
             -
  f(xi_d) =  >  b_l  K(eta_l - xi_d)       (d=0,...,D-1)
             -          
            l=0

  where xi_d, eta_l are arbitrary nodes on the sphere given in spherical 
  coordinates (theta,phi) from [0,pi]x[-pi,pi), b_l are complex coefficients 
  and K: [-1,1] -> C is a kernel function. Such kernels include the Poisson and 
  the Singularity kernel as well as locally supported kernels and the spherical
  Gaussian kernel (see [1]).

  The algorithm used is based on the fast spherical Fourier transform for
  arbitrary nodes (NFSFT) and therefore depends on the NFFT C-library. New 
  kernels can be incorporated easily by defining an appropriate C-function 
  (see kernels.c for some examples).

  fastsumS2.c is an example for the usage of the library. The MATLAB script
  file fastsumS2.m calls the MATLAB function fastsum.m, which is a simple
  example for the usage in MATLAB.
