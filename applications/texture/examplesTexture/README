Each script of the form testx_y executes text x with parameter set y.
I used them for the calculations of my "Studienarbeit".
To see what they do, read the scripts or the description below.

test1
Convergence test of the CGNE algorithm without damping factors for samples
created from uniformly distributed frequencies.

test2
Convergence test of the CGNE algorithm with 1/i^2 damping factors for samples
created from uniformly distributed frequencies.

test3
Convergence test of the CGNR algorithm for samples
created from uniformly distributed frequencies.

test4 (deprecated)
Regularity test with the CGNR algorithm.
For some uniformly distributed frequencies, it will be tested, if they can
be reconstructed from its samples.
This setting is repeated for various N, N1, N2.

test5 (deprecated)
Regularity test with the CGNE algorithm without damping factors.
For some uniformly distributed frequencies, it will be tested, if they can
be reconstructed from its samples.
This setting is repeated for various N, N1, N2.

test6 (deprecated)
Regularity test with the CGNE algorithm with 1/i^2 damping factors.
For some uniformly distributed frequencies, it will be tested, if they can
be reconstructed from its samples.
This setting is repeated for various N, N1, N2.

test7 (deprecated)
Monitors the residuum of the CGNE algorithm without damping factors on samples
created from uniformly distributed frequencies.

test8 (deprecated)
Monitors the residuum of the CGNE algorithm with 1/i^2 damping factors on 
samples created from uniformly distributed frequencies.

test9
Convergence test of the CGNR algorithm on perturbed samples created
from uniformly distributed frequencies.

test10
Convergence test of the CGNE algorithm without damping factors on perturbed
samples created from uniformly distributed frequencies.

test11
Regularity test with the CGNR algorithm.
For some uniformly distributed frequencies, it will be tested, if they can
be reconstructed from its samples.
This setting is repeated for various N, N1, N2.

test12
Regularity test with the CGNE algorithm without damping factors.
For some uniformly distributed frequencies, it will be tested, if they can
be reconstructed from its samples.
This setting is repeated for various N, N1, N2.

test13
Convergence test on the dubna1 data with CGNR.

test14
Convergence test on the dubna1 data with CGNE without damping factors.
