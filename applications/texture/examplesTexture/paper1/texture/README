*** Data and Programs ***

h*, r*: 
A file containing a node or pole figure.

omega*: 
Files containing frequency vectors.

omega1:
N = 128, decayment 1/(l+1)^(1.5)

omega2:
N = 32, decayment 1/(l+1)^(1.5)

omega3:
N = 4, decayment 1/(l+1)^(1.5)

omega4:
N = 8, decayment 1/(l+1)^(1.5)

omega5:
N = 16, decayment 1/(l+1)^(1.5)

omega6:
N = 32, decayment 1/(l+1)^(9.5)

omega7:
N = 128, decayment 1/(l+1)^(10)

output:
Contains the output generated by test.c.

test.c:
The main program.

*** Administrative Files ***

get_job.sh:
Blocks a job and passes it to run_job.sh.
