List of files:

compareSamples, compareSamples.c: 
A useful program, to find out if two sample vectors are equal.

create, create.c:
Converts the original data from Ralf to the representation that the functions 
of texture_util can read.

data:
The rawdata from Ralf.

factor:
deprecated

grid_size:
1. line: N1,
2. line: N2.

h_file:
Output from create: The polefigures.

h_files:
The result of "ls data". An input for create.

lock.sh:
Write protects output files from create and omega*.

Makefile, Makefile.am, Makefile.in:
For make, automake, ...

newwigner<version>.nb:
Notebooks to create the frequency vectors.

omega.16:
The frequency vector generated by newwigner5.nb after conversion to the
format that the functions of texture_util can read. (the final one)

omega.orig.16:
The frequency vector generated by newwigner5.nb. (the final one)

plotpf.m:

A matlab function for reading r vectors.

readx.m:
A matlab function for reading sample vectors.

r_file:
Output of create: The nodes. (not! the final one)

r_file_flipped:
Like r_file, but \phi is exchanged by -\phi. (the final one)

samples:
Output of create: The samples.

samples.16:
The result of a texture transform on omega.16, h_file and r_file_flipped.

samples_unnormed:
deprecated

Instructions from Ralf.

unlock.sh:
