This directory contains the kernel of the texture transform.
If you want to use it, include nfft3_texture.h and link against 
./libs/libtexture.a.
The directories nfsft_obsolete and examplesNfsft_obsolete are obsolete and can 
be removed from my point of view.
The directory examplesTexture containes example calculations, useful utility 
functions and a program to check the correctness of the transform.
