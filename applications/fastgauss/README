  README            this file
  fastgauss.c       univariate Gauss transform and tests
  levelplots.m	    visualisation with MATLAB of error estimates

....

  ndft_fast.m       visualisation with MATLAB, calls the executable ndft_fast
  nfft_times.c      compares 1d, 2d, and 3d times to compute nffts and ffts,
                    outputs a latex-table
  taylor_nfft.c     compares the nfft with a taylor expansion based one
  taylor_nfft.m     visualisation with MATLAB, calls the executable taylor_nfft

The executable produces by default a simple test and prints to stdout.
By changing the subroutine call in the source code, different tests are
performed. Piped to files and used by the MATLAB file show_results, the figures
in our joint paper have been produced.
