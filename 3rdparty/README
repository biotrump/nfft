This directory contains third party code that is needed to build NFFT3. The
code consists of different third party software packages or parts thereof that
are distributed under the GPL or a compatible software license. This directory
does, however, not contain the FFTW3 library which is also needed to build
NFFT3. It is available from http://www.fftw.org separately. All code in
subpackages is copyright of the respective authors as stated in each
subdirectory. Currently included packages are

CSTRIPACK - A C-version of the Fortran STRIPACK package to compute Delaunay
            triangulations and Voronoi partitions on the unit sphere

      GSL - Part of the GNU scientific library (GSL) needed to evaluate
            spherical Bessel functions.
