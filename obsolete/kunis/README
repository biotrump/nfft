This is the README file for nfft, a library that implements a nonequispaced fast
Fourier transform and its generalised inverse.

This is the second version of the library and may not be as robust or well
documented as it should be. Please keep track of bugs or missing/confusing
instructions and report them to kunis@math.uni-luebeck.de or 
potts@math.uni-luebeck.de .

################################################################################
WHAT IT DOES:

The fast transform implemented is based on the paper:
'Fast Fourier transforms for nonequispaced data: A tutorial', by D.Potts,
G. Steidl, and M. Tasche, Modern Sampling Theory: Mathematics and Applications,
J.J. Benedetto and P. Ferreira (Eds.), Chapter 12, pages 249-274. 

For the inverse transform see also the paper:
'Stability Results Scattered Data Interpolation by Trigonometric Polynomials' by
S. Kunis and D. Potts, preprint A-04-12, Institute of Mathematics, University of
Luebeck.

Also available, on this web page, are PostScript, Acrobat PDF and online
versions of the documentation.

Key points:

1. This transform is approximate, but allows you to set the precision needed.
This does not cause any difficulties, but does require you to think about the
precision needed.

2. This transform has some initialisation phase. If you plan to do only one
transforms of a given size, precomputation may be disabled to save memory.

3. The break even with respect to the direct (slow) transform is very low.

INSTALLATION:

1. Install the fftw library, available from http://www.fftw.org .
Generally this will mean: 

./configure --prefix <FFTW_PATH>
make
make install
make clean

2. Download from http://www.math.uni-luebeck.de/potts/nfft
> tar xfv nfft.tar
./nfft2> ./configure <FFTW_PATH>
./nfft2> make

################################################################################
BUGS:

Please report any problems to kunis@math.uni-luebeck.de or 
potts@math.uni-luebeck.de . 

################################################################################
IMPROVEMENTS:

If you find this library lacking useful routines or options, please describe
what you would like to kunis@math.uni-luebeck.de or potts@math.uni-luebeck.de .
If it seems appropriate it can be included in later versions. If you create your
own routines that you are willing to donate to the effort, send them too.
