NFFT3 - Nonequispaced FFT and its generalisation, inversion, and application

 Copyright (C) 2002-2006 Daniel Potts

 The NFFT package was developed at the Mathematical Institute, University of
 Luebeck, and at the Faculty of Mathematics, Chemnitz University of Technology.

This is the README file for NFFT3, a C library that implements
 1) the nonequispaced fast Fourier transform (nfft)
 2) generalisations to NFFTs
    - on the sphere (nfsft)
    - on the hyperbolic cross (nsfft)
    - for real-valued data, i.e. (co)sine transforms, (nfct, nfst)
 3) their generalised inverses
 4) applications to
    - magnetic resonance imaging
    - summation schemes (fast Gauss transform, singular kernels, zonal kernels)
    - polar FFT, discrete Radon transform, ridgelet transform
